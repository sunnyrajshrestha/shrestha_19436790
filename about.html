In all this ruckus,in all these battles,I walk the earth as a warrior of my own;on my own.
In all this chaos,in all these battles,I walk the earth as a warrior of my own;on my own.
Of all these tyrants,in all these battles, I walk the earth as a  prince of my own;on my own.
Of all these vermin,in all these battles,I walk the earth as a prince of my own;on my own.
Amongst all these demons,in all these battles,I walk the earth as a demigod of my own;on my own
Amongst all these scum,in all these battles, I walk the earth as a demigod of my own; on my own.
